# Controlling two motors using H-Bridge

In this circuit I used two motors, an H-Bridge driver,9V battery, and two potentiometers replacing a joystick since Tinkercad doesn't have joystick component.
In this circuit first potentiometer is used for vertical movemnet (Up and Down), and the second potentiometer is used for vertical movement (Left and Right).

For my wiring colors:
Red wires for positive high voltage
Negative wires for ground
Orange wires for motors connection
Green wires for enable pins
Blue wires for input of the motors
Yellow wires for Analog signal
